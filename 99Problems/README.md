# 99 Problems - Fight or Flight

“99Problems” is an arcade survival android mobile game designed with a concept revolving around running endlessly away from one’s problems. The game design is simple, with just “problems” (in-game enemy), and “solutions” (in-game power-ups).

This project exposed me to the following:
> Unity's Physics engine  
> Building an android game project  
> Interfacing with phone's gyroscope to control player's movement  
> Adding sound effects into game  
> Use of couroutines to handle timers

Feel free to try out the game!
